## Overview

**Tally** is a slow-paced, single-player, browser-based word game designed to test your vocabulary and strategy. The player's task is to play yet unplayed words despite increasing restrictions on which letters can and cannot be used.

## How to Play

1. Upon starting the game, you are given a tile of a random letter (you will aquire many).
2. Advance to the next round by playing words that use the letters on your tiles (they can also use other letters).
3. You must use each tile letter *exactly* five times to advance.
3. When you advance to the next round, you are given the tile of a letter you used most last round, and the tallies are reset.


### Controls

- Type a word on the input line in the center of the window. 
- Press `enter` or `return` to submit the word.
- Clicking the `?` in the top right corner will remind you of the rules.
